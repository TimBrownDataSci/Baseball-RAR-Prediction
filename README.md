# This project serves as a quick dive into player value prediction through a player's age 30 season. This is a very basic and quick exploration of these topics. There are many more in-depth and intesive avenues that this concept can and has been pursued. The data sets are sourced from http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/ which contain basic offensive stats as well as counts of defensive starts. Many assumptions and simplifications of key metrics are made for the sake of simplification as this is moreso a proof-of-concept rather than an actionable report.
