    "This project serves as a quick dive into player value prediction through a player's age 30 season. This is a very basic and quick exploration of these topics. There are many more in-depth and intesive avenues that this concept can and has been pursued. The data sets are sourced from http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/ which contain basic offensive stats as well as counts of defensive starts. Many assumptions and simplifications of key metrics are made for the sake of simplification as this is moreso a proof-of-concept rather than an actionable report."

Hopefully any coefficient given to this feature in a model will only affect the prediction if the player had been a top ranked prospect. Otherwise any weight given will be discarded.

From a quick cursory glance, it seems that the projections may need to weigh past performance more as single seasons heavily influence the projections, leading to large disparities from one-off season performances. Though commonalities between top performers would certainly be an interesting and worthwhile pursiut."

Further exploration into why is something I would like to pursue. Multiple cleaning parameters were also placed upon the training data that has the potential for bias(i.e. AB mins, base-running exclusion, etc...)."
