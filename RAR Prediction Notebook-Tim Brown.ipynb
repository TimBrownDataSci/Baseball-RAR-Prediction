    "This project serves as a quick dive into player value prediction through a player's age 30 season. This is a very basic and quick exploration of these topics. There are many more in-depth and intesive avenues that this concept can and has been pursued. The data sets are sourced from http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/ which contain basic offensive stats as well as counts of defensive starts. Many assumptions and simplifications of key metrics are made for the sake of simplification as this is moreso a proof-of-concept rather than an actionable report."

    "Playing around with our model results, we can see that the Neural Network model mostly mirrors the predictions of our Basic Linear Regression model. This further adds to the srgument that more complicated modelling methods may not always add value and may instead reduce the interpretability of your findings. Regardless, Deep Learning methods are sure to be useful once larger compute power and data sets are widely available. The current training system is limited by my personal computing and time restraints that an enterprise or front office would not be subject to."
